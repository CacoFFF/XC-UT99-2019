// This is going to be a drag...

// Given we're ditching box collision, we'll transform the trace using XY
// Sure, it's one more transformation but it saves the code from transforming
// the entire mesh

//I'll avoid tracing both sides of a surface, that's just an insane amount of effort

/*
What to cache:
- The whole base mesh exists already..
- So we apply any transformation excepting yaw, because yaw doesn't alter cylinder collision
- Transform vertices, cache vertices using original indices
- Caching should be done using FVector4 (fplane here)
- The array has to be manually allocated using 16 bit alignment
- I should allocate triangle planes too using FVector4
- To do that i have to allocate a dynamic array of vertex indices
