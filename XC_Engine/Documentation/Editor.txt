==============
 Manual setup:

Add the new EditPackages line in UnrealTournament.ini under:
[Editor.EditorEngine]
...
EditPackages=XC_EditorAdds


========
 Addons:

- Level cleanup:
Compacts the actor list and removes texture information from brush faces that
don't currently have an existing surface in the map's BSP construction.
This is very useful to get rid of unused textures that remain referenced by
hidden/non-built faces from brushes.

- Brush To Mesh:
Converts the selected brush into a mesh and spawns an actor at the brush's location.
The user must specify a unique mesh name.
Additionally texture tiling can be simulated by splitting the mesh into smaller faces.
Default actor class is Unreali.Knife
Default package is MyLevel (embedded into map).
*Note: The mesh shouldn't have more than 7 unique textures

- Measure Distance:
Compares distance between two selected actors.
Compares distance between one selected actor and it's nearest camera.

- Properties Window:
Opens up a fixed property window on the selected actor, this one doesn't change when
selecting another actor.
Also, the 'None' tab displays the hidden properties.

- Actor Transform
Applies various transformation steps to the selected actors.
Clicking on the button without any selected actors or transformation steps
will display quick usage instructions.

- Setup Lift Paths
Select LiftCenter, LiftExit nodes (and optionally a mover) and link them using
the same LiftTag.
Clicking on the button without any selected actors will display quick usage instructions.
