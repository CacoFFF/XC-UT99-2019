Enhanced Netcode
================

For use with the new relevancy system, requires XC_GameEngine.bUseNewRelevancy=True
The new relevancy system is a full rewrite of the actor prioritizator and visibility check system
used to determine how and when actors are relevant to other clients over net play.
It also affects in some cases how actor updates are done.

Additionally, a lot of changes have been introduced to reduce bandwidth usage from
server to client.


=========
Features:

Dynamic Tickrate:
- Bandwidth saturation detection, artificially reduces update rate of clients.
** Spectators' dynamic tickrate is always set to half of normal players.
** This makes increasing max server tickrate to higher values possible (limit=120).
- On clients with XC_Engine v24 or greater, the dynamic tickrate is capped to the client's framerate.

Actor prioritization:
- Active discarding of less relevant actors in case of channel saturation.
- Prevents servers from being inaccesible and allows players to see their inventory and nearby enemies.
- Owned actor bursting, clients receive actors they own earlier and with higher priority.
- Benefits replication of owned actors and low frequency info holders.

Bandwidth saving:
- Simulated pawns don't have their location updated if moving in straight lines.
- Unnecessary Rotation, Velocity updates no longer sent.
- USERFLAG saturation addressed, players don't get more than 20 messages per second.
- Players receive less position adjustment updates at higher tickrates.


=====================
Extended actor flags:

Actors now have additional replication variables that allow the relevancy loop to modify
the behaviour of the relevancy checks on them, increasing capabilities and reducing workload.
These flags are unaccessible to compiled unrealscript code, in order to enable these flags
on one or more actors the coder must either:
- Apply a global 'SET' command.
- Individually call SetPropertyText on said actor.

* bNotRelevantToOwner *
This actor is not sent to the player that owns the connection.
Extremely useful on lag compensators that uses separate client/server effects.

* bRelevantIfOwnerIs *
This actor becomes synchronized with it's owner when it comes to being relevant
to other clients, this means that if the owner is relevant to a client, so is this actor.
This is applied by default on ShieldBelt effects.

* bRelevantToTeam *
This actor becomes relevant to an entire team (best used with bAlwaysRelevant for backwards compatibility)
The actor must have a 'byte' variable named 'Team' in order for this condition to work.

* bSuperClassRelevancy *
If this actor isn't on the network communication map and therefore cannot be replicated, then the
relevancy loop will attempt to replicate a superclass version of this actor that can be replicated.
Useful for small weapon/monster AI modifications without expanding the network package list.
WARNING: DO NOT HOTSWITCH BETWEEN NEW/OLD RELEVANCY CODE IF YOU HAVE bSuperClassRelevancy ACTORS IN THE LEVEL
