=========================
Automatic cache converter
=========================

The Automatic cache converter is a simple setting that allows the client to copy
files delivered by the current server it's connected to into the package folders
with correct names and cases.

The file copy operations occur immediately after loading the map on a remote
server and new files will be placed into the first directory that matches the
file system criterias.

All file copy operations will be logged and won't replace existing files.


======
Usage:

This option is disabled by default, you must enable it in order for it to work.
Set XC_GameEngine.bCacheConvertAtJoin=True.

- The option can be modified via INI as follows
[XC_Engine.XC_GameEngine]
bCacheConvertAtJoin=True

- Or via a command:
SET XC_GAMEENGINE bCacheConvertAtJoin 1


=========
Examples:

- Copying downloaded files into default folders
[Core.System]
Paths=../System/*.u
Paths=../Maps/*.unr
Paths=../Textures/*.utx
Paths=../Sounds/*.uax
Paths=../Music/*.umx

- Copying downloaded files into a common folder
[Core.System]
Paths=../Downloaded/*.u
Paths=../Downloaded/*.unr
Paths=../Downloaded/*.utx
Paths=../Downloaded/*.uax
Paths=../Downloaded/*.umx
Paths=../System/*.u
Paths=../Maps/*.unr
Paths=../Textures/*.utx
Paths=../Sounds/*.uax
Paths=../Music/*.umx
-> Make sure you create the folder you're going to use!!
