LZMA in Unreal Tournament:
==========================

=====================
 Package downloading:

Clients can query redirects and UT [XC] servers for LZMA files.
Servers can send the compressed package if the LZMA (or UZ) file is on the
same directory as the package.

It is possible to enable automatic LZMA compression on a XC_Engine server.
As soon as a server loads a map, it'll automatically compress the files that
are eligible to be sent to clients.
See: "XC_GameEngine settings" in documentation.

The automatic LZMA compressor on XC_Engine servers now stores it's LZMA
cache both in memory and "../LzmaCache/", see the "LzmaCache.ini" in
said directory to modify the behaviour of the LZMA compressor.


===================================
Automatic LZMA compressor settings:

; If enabled, do not print compression actions to log
Silent=true

; Push largest packages to file cache if total in memory exceeds this
MaxMemCacheMegs=16

; Purge oldest packages from file cache if total in disk exceeds this
MaxFileCacheMegs=256

; Any uncompressed package larger than this is automatically pushed to file cache
ForceSourceToFileMegs=8


=========================
 Compression commandlets:

You can LZMA compress files using a XC_Core commandlet:
> UCC LZMACompress ..\Maps\CTF-Coret.unr

You can LZMA decompress files using 7zip, WinRar or:
> UCC LZMADecompress ..\Maps\CTF-Coret.unr.lzma

Both commandlets support wildcards.
