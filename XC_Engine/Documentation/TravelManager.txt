TravelManager:
=================
The TravelManager is a small addon that's inserted into the game upon XC_GameEngine initialization.
It can receive console commands and controls the travel list when a server is running.

=== Global Features:
- Automatically corrects the existing level's travel list owner (if any) when a player changes name.
If a player's new name already has an existing travel entry, the name change is reverted!.
This means that a player cannot override an existing travel entry with his own.
Players' travel info is kept for as long as the coop chain isn't broken.

When (XC_GameEngine.bAutoTravelManager = True):
- Scans current connections and updates the client's travel list items every two seconds.
The scanning is performed using class and property caching, avoiding any kind of slowdowns in extremely high traffic theoretical scenarios.
The most obvious effect of enabling this setting, is the ability to recover all items/status a player had prior to disconnection.
This can be turned on or off in runtime safely.

=== Commands:
- TravelInfo
Lists players and their items in the Single Player travel list!

- TravelUpdate
Forces manual travel list update on multiplayer games.
Coop games may implement this if they don't want to run with bAutoTravelManager.
